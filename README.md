# GRVFL-MV: Graph Random Vector Functional Link Based on Multi-View Learning

Please cite the following paper if you are using this code. Reference: M. Tanveer, R. K. Sharma, M. Sajid, A. Quadir (2025). GRVFL-MV: Graph Random Vector Functional Link Based on Multi-View Learning, Information Sciences, Elsevier.


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% 
The experiments are executed on a computing system possessing Python 3.11 software, an Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU E5-2697 v4 processor operating at 2.30 GHz with 128-GB Random Access Memory (RAM), and a Windows-11 operating platform.

We have put a demo of the “GRVFL-MV” model with the “aus” dataset

The following are the best hyperparameters set with respect to the “aus” dataset

Description of files: 
main.py: This is the main file to run selected algorithms on datasets. In the path variable specificy the path to the folder containing the codes and datasets on which you wish to run the algorithm. 
Graph.py: Generation of Graph matrix.
RVFL.py: Solving the optimization problem.

For the detailed experimental setup, please follow the paper. If you find any bugs/issues, please write to A. Quadir (mscphd2207141002@iiti.ac.in) and M. Sajid (phd2101241003@iiti.ac.in).
